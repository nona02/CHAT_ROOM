# CHAT_ROOM

In this project, I have created a Chat room using GUI. For creating connection between client and server I have used socket library, and for synchronization of the messages threading module. Use of various Tkinter widgets like buttons, labels, scroll, text, etc. have been used to create a basic User Interface for the application.
